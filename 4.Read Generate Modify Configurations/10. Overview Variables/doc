Repeated static values is more work in the future
better solution would be define Repeated values in one central place
Terraform input variables are used to pass certain values from outside of the configuration

Example

Name       value

vpn_ip     101.0.62.210/32
app_port   8080

resource "aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule" "allow_tls_ipv4" {
    security_group_id = ""
    cidr_ipv4 = var.vpn_ip
    from_port = var.app_port
    ip_protocol "tcp"
    to_port = var.app_port
}

No need to touch the core Terraform configuration file. This can avoid huma mistakes while editing.

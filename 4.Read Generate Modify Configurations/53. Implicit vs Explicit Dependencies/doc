# Setting the Base

# There are 2 ways to define dependencies in Terraform
Imlicit and Explicit

# Explicit dependencies are declared using the depend_on meta-argument

You use this whe there's no direct attribute referece, but you still need to controll the order of resource creation.

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
    ami = "ami-dfdsfds"
    instance_type = "t3.micro"
    depend_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
    bucket = "edox-demo-s3-bucket-007"
}

#       Sample Requirement
# EC2 should only allow communication from trusted set of IP addresses

# Resources Need: EC2 + SG


# For Explicit YOu should use depends_on like in case of

aws_instance_example
        |
    depends_on
        |
aws_s3_bucket_example

# For Implicit Dependency

aws_security_group.prod
        |
  used in attribute
        |
aws_instane-example

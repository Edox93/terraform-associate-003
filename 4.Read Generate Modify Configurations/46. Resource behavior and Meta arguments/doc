A resource block declares thaht you weant a particular infrastructure object to exist with the given settings

# How Terraform Applies a Configuration
Create resource that exist in the Configuration but are not associated with real infrastructure object in the state
Destroy resources that exist in the state but no longer exist in the configuration

Update in-place resources whose arguments have changed

Destroy and re-create resources whose arguments have changed but which cannot be updated in-place due to remote API limitations.


# Understanding the Limitations
What happens if we want to change the default behavior?
Example: Some modification happened in Real Infrastructue object that is not part of Terraform but you want to ignore changes during terraform apply.


# Solution - Using Meta Arguments

Terraform allwos us to include meta-argument within the resource block which allows some details of this standard resource behavior to be customized on a per-resource basis

You can add lifecycle() block inside of resource block

resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
    ami = "ami-0f34c5ae932e6f0e4"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"

    tags = {
        Name = "HelloEarth"
    }

    lifecycle {
        ignore_changes = [tags]
    }
}

# Different Meta-Arguments

depends_on 
count
for_each

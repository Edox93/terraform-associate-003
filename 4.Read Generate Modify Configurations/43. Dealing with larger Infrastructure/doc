Using cloud provider does not mean you have access to ulimited resources
There are some limits that apply to all of the services


Less Known Limit - API Limit in AWS

When you are architecting for the cloud, you need to keep API throttling in mind, particulary the types of call and the frequency with wich they are called.

When the allotted rate limit for an API call is exceeded, you will recieve an error response and the call will be throttled.

Time to Slow Down
Whenever you are designing Yerraform projects, you have to take in mind the API limits of the provider to avoid throthling that will futher impact production systems.

       project-3
sg.tf

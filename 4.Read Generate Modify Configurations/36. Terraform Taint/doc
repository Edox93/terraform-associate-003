# Old command "terraform taint"
# New command "terraform apply -repace  <resource name>"


You have created a new resource via Terraform
Users have made a lot of manual changes (both infrastructur and inside the server)

Two ways to deal with this: Import Changes to Terraform/Delete & Recrea the resource



           ######### Recreating the Resource 
The -replace option with terraform apply to force Terraform to replace an object even
though there are no configuration changes that would require it


For example: someone change a something in ec2 manual and you want to change to terraform file state

terraform apply -replace="aws_instance.myec2"
# terraform will destroy and recreate

From Terraform v0.15.2 and late, Hashicorp recommend using the -replace  option with terraform apply    instead of terraform taint

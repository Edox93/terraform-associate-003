Local Values are similar to variables in a sense that it allows you to store data centraly and that can be referenced in ,ultiple parts of configuration

Additional 
U can add expressions to locals, which allows you to compute values dynamically

locals {
    # Ids for multiple set of EC2 , merged together
  instance_ids = concat(aws_instance.blue.*.id, aws_instance.green.*.id)
}

In variable functions not allowed

Variable value can be defined in wide variety of places like terraform.tfvars, ENV Variables, CLI and so on

Locals are more of a private resource. You have to directly modify the code.

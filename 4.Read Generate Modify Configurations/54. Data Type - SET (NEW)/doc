Revising List Data Type

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable

These items can be dublicates as well.

#   Linst and Index
# List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
variable "user_names" {
    type = list
    default = ["alice","bob","john"]
}

# SET data type can only store unique elements.
variable "my_set" {
    type = set(string)
    default = ["alice","bob","john"]
//    default = ["john","bob","alice"]  # if you change positions of elements in case of set it willnot sho changes
}


# Point to Note

While defining a SET, you need to also define the type of value that is expected
variable "my-set" {
    type = set(string)
}



# SET is Unordered
# A set does not store the order of the elements
# Terraform only tracks the presence of elements, not their order.

# revising Map Data Type

variable "my-map" {
    type = map(number)
}

output "variable_value" {
    value = var.my-map
}

In a basic setup, a map is a collection of key-value pairs. where all values must be of the same type where as keys are string.

Strict structure is not required explicity

#        Introducing Object Data Type
# An object  is also a collection of key-value pairs, but each value can be of a different type.
# A proper structure is generally required while defining object data type.
variable "my-object" {
  type = object({Name = string, userID = number})
}

output "variable_value" {
  value = var.my-object
}

#       Keep in Mind the Syntax
# object(..) a collection of named attributes that each have their own type
# The schema of object types is  {<KEY> = <TYPE>,<KEY> = <TYPE>, ...}  - pair of curly braces containing a comma-separated series of <KEY> = <TYPE> pairs.

# Extra attributes are descarded during type conversion

# type = object({Name = string, userID = number})
# {"Name"="Zeal", "userID"=1234,"email"="insturctors@gmail.com"}
# the output will be without email

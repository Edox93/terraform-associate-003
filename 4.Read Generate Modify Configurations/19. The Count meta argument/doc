By Default, A resource block configures one real infrastructure object

The count argument accepts a whole numer, that creates many instances of the resource

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami = "ami-0bdd88bd06d16ba03"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  count = 3
}

But for some Resurces, example IAM
 it's not required and not will work

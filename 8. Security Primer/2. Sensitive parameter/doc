# Base
By default Terraform will show the values associated with defined attributes in the CLI output 
durin plan, apply operation for most of the resources․

# What to expect
We should design our terraform code in such way that no sensitive information 
is available and shown out of the box in CLI Output, Logs, etc.

# basic fo Sensitive parameter
Adding sensitive parameter ensures that you do not accidentally expose this data in CLI Output, log output

# Sensitive Values AND Output Values
If you try to reference sensitive value in output values, Terraform will immediately giv you an error.
Example:
variable "sensitive_content" {
  sensitive = true
  default = "f4sdf4ds5passw0rd"
}

resource "local_file" "foo" {
  content = var.sensitive_content
  filename = "password.txt"
}

output "content" {
  value =  local_file.foo.content
}
Error: Output refers to sensitive value

# Sensitive Values AND Output Values
If you still want sensitive content to be available in "output" of state file but
should not be visible in CLI Output, Logs, following approach can be used ad to output sensitive key pair
output "content" {
  value =  local_file.foo.content
  sensitive = "true"
}

In CLi output will see:
pass = <sensitive>

# Important
Sensitive param will NOT protect/redact ifno from State file
# If you want to protect it in tfstate file too it will be in different video

# Benefits of mature Providers
Various providers like AWS will automaticall considers the passwor argument for any database as sensitive and will redact it as a sensitive value
Example in:

resource "aws_db_event_subscription" "default" {
  allocated_storage = 10
  db_name = "mydb"
  engine = "mysql"
  engine_version = "8.0"
  instance_class = "db.t3.micro"
  username = "foo"
  password = "d65f6sd"
  parameter_group_name = "default.mysql8.0"
  skip_final_snapshot = true
}
# in terraform plan pass will be sensitive in output
for username u can do with variable
variable "db_user" {
  default = "admin"
  sensitive = true
}

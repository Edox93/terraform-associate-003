hardcoding access and secret key in file is not optimal for security point.

By Default If you not define secrets the terraform will search it in
"$HOME/.aws/config" and "$HOME/.aws/credentials" on Linux and MacOS
"%USERPROFILE%\.aws\config" and "%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials" for Windows

If you setup aws cli to work with aws the credentials and configs aws cli will use from same paths like terraform

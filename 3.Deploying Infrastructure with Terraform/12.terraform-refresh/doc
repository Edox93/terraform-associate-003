terraform refresh

The terraform refresh command was used to update the Terraform state file 
to reflect the actual state of resources in the infrastructure. 

If u change manual something in current state u can run terraform refresh  to update desired state file, and after that terraform plan will show no changes

If you create a ec2, after change something in resource (example ami or region), after run terraform plan, terraform will show noew change to run in , but in this case if you run terraform refresh, the terraform will not find it in current state and clean up your current tf.state file
Be Careful
BUt we have tf.state.backup for some cases

terraform refresh is depricated in new version of terraform

The -refresh-only option for terraform plan and terraform apply was  introduced in Terraform v0.15.4

The terraform refresh command, while previously a standalone command, is now effectively replaced by the -refresh-only flag used with terraform apply or terraform plan.
Purpose:
The primary purpose of terraform refresh (or its modern equivalent) is to synchronize the Terraform state file with the current, real-world state of your infrastructure. This is crucial when manual changes have been made to resources outside of Terraform's management, leading to "configuration drift."

if you define specific version
or range and after change this version upper or less 
the .terraform.lock.hcl will lock (constraints) your first version
U can delete that file and run init to download changed version 
Or u can call terraform init -upgrade to update lock file version

example in .terraform.lock.hcl:
provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws" {
  version     = "6.19.0"
  constraints = "~> 6.0"
} 



Error:
 Error: Failed to query available provider packages

Could not retrieve the list of available versions for provider hashicorp/aws: locked provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws 6.19.0 does    
not match configured version constraint 5.0.0; must use terraform init -upgrade to allow selection of new versions

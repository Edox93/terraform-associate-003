2. Verify if the code works in the latest version of Terraform and Provider.
3. Modify and Fix the code so thaht it works with latest version of Terraform.
4. Modify and Fix the code sh that it works with latest version of Terraform.

# Hints
1. Based on the initial code given to you, use appropriate version of binaries to ensure infrastructur gets created successfully.
2. There are hardcoded AWS access/secret keys with the code.
This MUST be be fixed.

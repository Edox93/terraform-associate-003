# Basic of Creation time provisioners

By default provisioners run when the resource they are defined within is created.

Creation-time provisioners are only run during creation, not during updating or any other lifecycle

# Destroy time provisioner

Destroy provisioners are run before the resource is destroyed
Example: nginx will be removed and after instance will be destroyed

# Tainting Resource in creation-time provisioners
If a creation-time provisioner fails, the resource is marked as tained
A tainted resource will be planned for destruction an recreation upn the next terraform apply.
Terraform does this because a failed provisioner can leave a resource in a semi-configured state


The state file that has marked the resource as "tainted"  because the provisioner had failed.

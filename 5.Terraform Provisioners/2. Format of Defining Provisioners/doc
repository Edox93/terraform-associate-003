# 1 - Defining Provisioners

# Provisioners are defined inside a specific  resource.
resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
    ami = "ami=fg987df9g7f9g7fd"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"

    <provisioners-need-to-be-defined-inside-resource>
    provisioner "local-exec" {
        command = "echo Server has been created through Terraform"
    }
    provisioner "remote-exec" {}
}

#   Remote exec provisioner approach
# Sine command are executed on remote-server, we have to provide way for Terraform to connect to remote server.

# Point to Note 

As much as possible, avoid hardcoding values as part of the Modules
This will make the module less flexible

# Convert Hard Coded Vlues to Variables
For modules it is especiially recomended to convert hard-coded values to variables so thT it can be overridden based on user requirements

# Advantages of Variabl in Module Code
Variable based approach will allow the teams to override the values

# Reviewing Prof EC2 module code
Reviewing an EC2 module code that is professionally written, we see that the values associated with arguments are not hardcoded and variables are used extensively

# Advantages of Variable in Module Code
Variable based approach will allow the teams to override the values

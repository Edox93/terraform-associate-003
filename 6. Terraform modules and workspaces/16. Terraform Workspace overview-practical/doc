# Setting the Base
An infrustructure created throug Terraform is tied to the underlying Terraform
configuration and a state file.

#       What if?
What if we have multiple state file for single Terraform configuration?
Can we manage diff env's throughe it separately?

# Terraform Wokrspace
Terraform workspaces enable us to manage multiple set of deployments from the same sets of configuration file.

# terraform workspace list
# terraform workspace select dev
# terraform workspace new prd

#  Flexibility with Workspace
Depending on the workspace being used, the value to a specific argument in your Terraform code can also change

# commands:  
delete: deleta a workspace
list: show all worksapces
new: create a workspace
select: switch to workspace
show: current workspace

# Step 1 - Passing Providers Explicitily
YOu can ise provider argument ithin a module block to Explicitily define wich provider configuration are available the child module

# Step 2 - Declare COnfiguaration Aliases
In the child module, you need also delcare the configuration aliases for the provider.

# Step 3 - You can use provider meta-argument within resource to choose appropriate provider configuration

# Point to Node
The providers argument within a module block is simmilar to the provider argument within a resource, but is a map rather then a single string because a module may contain resources from many different providers.

Provider configuartion (those with the alias argument set) are never inhrited automaticaly by child modules, and so must always be passed explicity using tho providers map

It can happen that all the resources in an organization are created manually

Organizaton wants to start using terraform and manages these resources via terraform

# Older approach for terraform import
terraform import would crreate the state file ssociated with te resourcs running in your environment.
And users still had to write the tf fils from scratch

# Current approach for terraform import
terraform import can automatically create the terraform configuration files for th resources ou want to import

# Point of Note
Terraform 1.5 introuduces automatic code generation for imported resources.

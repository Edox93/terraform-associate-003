# Base
Backends primarily determine where Terraform stres its state file

When u not psecify a backend block in our Terraform config, Terraform uses the default local backend thaht stores terraform.tfstate in the same project folder

1. Code be stored in Git
2. tfstate in centralized Backend

# Terraform supports wide variety of remote backends

consul
s3
azurerm
gcs

# Default config for local state is
terraform {
    backend "local" {
        path = "relative/path/to/terraform.tfstate"
    }
}

store this in backend.tf

# Remote backend
Accessing state in a remote service generally requires some kind of access credentials
Some backend act like plain "remote disks" for state files; others support state locking funcionality
